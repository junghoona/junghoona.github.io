      Hello,
      My name is John, and I graduated from UCSB in 2020 with a BA in Economics.
      Currently, I am studying Computer Science at Irvine Valley College with interests in software programming, mobile app development, and web design.
      I have working knowledge of C, C++ Programming Language, and fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS for web programming.
      </p>
      <p>
      As I become more experienced with current programming languages and well-versed in other object-oriented programming languages such as Java, C# and Python,
      I aspire to become a full-stack developer to create projects designed to help underserved communities gain equitable access to resouces and opportunities,
      such as education, employment and health care.
      </p>
      <p>
      In my spare time, I like to stay active by working out at a local facility, playing basketball and hiking.
      I love trying out new food, exploring new sights, meeting new people, and learning new things.
      </p>
